# mac-hr-sane-layout
A Mac keyboard layout for Croatian PC users with some extra bells and whistles. Tested on a 60% keyboard.

The basic idea is to not screw up your muscle memory, while being more mac (US, that is) and programmer-friendly.
That includes keeping the `altGr` layer and the Croatian diacritical characters (šđčćž) where they were.

The standard and shift layers are the same as on a Croatian PC layout. The `cmd` layer has switched `Z` and `Y` keys for easier undo / redo.

As an added bonus, all dead keys are converted to standard outputs and all brackets are available on the `altGr` layer on the right side for single-hand usage.
