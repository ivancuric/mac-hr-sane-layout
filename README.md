# mac-hr-sane-layout
A sane Mac keyboard layout for Croatian PC users with some extra bells and whistles. And as the name implies, works great with a pok3r keyboard.

The basic idea of the layout is not to screw up your muscle memory, while being more mac (US, that is) and programmer-friendly. The best part is, now all US-centric Mac shortcuts actually work, including `cmd + [/]` for back/forward.
That includes keeping the `altGr` layer and the Croatian diacritical characters (šđčćž) where they were. If you don't use them, just use the `en-us` layout. _You illiterate bastard_.

The standard and shift layers are the same as on a Croatian PC layout. The `ctrl` and `cmd` layer behave like the en-us keyboard, including the switched `Z` and `Y` keys for easier undo / redo.
The `alt/opt` and the `alt/opt + shift` layers have a weird mix of `en-us` and `hr` layout.

A .dmg is included for easier installation.
